# Controllers

This directory contains controller modules that handle HTTP request/response logic.

Controllers will include:
- `authController.js` - Authentication endpoints (register, login, getCurrentUser)
- `taskController.js` - Task CRUD endpoints

Controllers receive requests, call services, and return responses.
