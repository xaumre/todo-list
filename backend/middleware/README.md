# Middleware

This directory contains Express middleware functions.

Middleware will include:
- `auth.js` - JWT token verification middleware
- `validation.js` - Input validation middleware
- `errorHandler.js` - Error handling middleware

Middleware functions process requests before they reach controllers.
